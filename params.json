{"name":"Battling","tagline":"Turn-based combat game for my kids ","body":"# Battling!\r\n\r\nBy Simon Gauld.\r\n\r\n2014-05-01\r\n\r\nDedicated to my two sons, Otto and Orin.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nBattling! is a turn-based combat game for two or more players.  It is meant to be a very simple version of combat games like Warhammer but for younger children who like The Hobbit and LOTR.   Hopefully it will act as a stepping stone to more complex roleplaying games for children.  \r\n\r\nIt is meant to be genre-shifting so you can set it with any combination of creatures you can think of based on the toys you have at hand - mutant ponies, action man, barbies, lego, pebbles, soft toys.  Also your setting is really just what you have at hand - a space scene, the shire, whatever.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the game is to meet your enemy in battle and smite his ruin down upon him etc.  Basically go watch The Hobbit and LOTR then come back.\r\n\r\nNote that these rules are as malleable as you need them to be in order to just plain enjoy yourself with your kids.   If it is too complicated, cut a bit out.  If you want a quick game, use 4 characters each. If you want a couple of hours, go for 40+ characters on your floor.\r\n\r\n## Prepare\r\n\r\nYou need to prepare some stuff for your first game.  After that, put it in a box and you have your game ready to go wherever you are.  Here's a list of ingredients:\r\n\r\n* Players.  Two players minimum although I suppose a bored child could play by themselves.  Actually no - **you must play with your children!!**\r\n* People (20 per player would be useful although you can play with just 1 person squads each in an RPG style (which I haven't thought about in any detail quite yet).\r\n* Dice (a box of six-sided dice is good).   **Note** dice are pronounced based on how many faces they have - \"dee-six\", \"dee-ten\" etc.   Naming dice is really important to me so make sure you get yourkids saying \"dee six\", \"dee ten\", \"dee four\" etc.   Basically get as many dice as you can find in your house, but definately at least 1.  Otherwise you have to make a dice which whilst fun is not the point of this particular game.\r\n* 1 or two A4 sheets of coloured card and some pens (paper will do if you dont have any)\r\n* in the game, pencils and paper for each player in the game to keep score\r\n* rulers to measure distance.  You could cut out some standard distance markers which might be handy. \r\n\r\n## How to play\r\n\r\n* Each player has a game sheet (paper), pencil and some old annual to lean on when writing.  They also bring 1-20 people to the table.  This is their `army`.  Ideally you want 20+ soldiers in your army.  \r\n\r\n* Give your army a name \"The Raving Loons\", \"Camelsdale Toestrokers\", \"Regimen of Ravens\".  Write this down at the top of your game sheet.\r\n\r\n* Assign a `Battle Commander` and give them a name.  \"Grimshaw Stupendicus\", \"Celerena Florian\", \"Rustnut The Boily\", \"Basher the Bignose\" etc.  Your Battle Commander tells the troops what to do and must NOT DIE otherwise you LOSE!.\r\n\r\n* Divide your people into two or more `squads`.  You will move each squad separaterly when we start playing.  **Tip**: Put four soldiers on a flat piece of lego to stick them together, then move them as a single squad.\r\n\r\n* Lay out your troops on one end of a `field of battle`.  This is normally called a floor.  Or a kitchen table.  \r\n\r\n* Put some buildings on the table, tin cans will do - lego buildings and overturned cards/things are great.  These act as obstacles.   E.g. you could put a river in the middle just with some paper coloured in and make it slower to cross, for example.\r\n\r\n* Each player roles some dice.  Highest score nominates who goes first (can be themselves).  After that, turns are played to the left.\r\n\r\n* Players soldiers are in `squads`.  Generally keep your squads 4+ otherwise it will take absolutely ages and you'll lose interest.   Each squad gets a go when it is the players turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Movement And Combat\r\n\r\nEach player gets a turn.  For each squad the player has, the squad will be able to `move` and `fight`.   \r\n\r\n### Movement\r\n\r\n* Roll 2 or more dice and add them together.  I call the total the \"move units\" avilable.  \r\n* Turning 90 degrees costs one move unit.  \r\n* You can then move your squad that many move units (called inches on your ruler).\r\n\r\n### Combat\r\n\r\nWhen a squad is physically close enough to the enemy, it can attack.  If you have archers, you can attack with them from a distance although they will be less effective.\r\n\r\nThe player whose turn it is gets to attack - the other player defends.  You can then nominate which lego fitures are attacking which lego figures although they have to be next to each other to fight.  face-to-face, you can have 2 attackers attacking 1 unit.\r\n\r\nPer lego player attacking, roll two dice and get the total.  Defender does the same.  Highest wins.\r\n\r\nAn attacker winning kills the defener.  A defender winning prevents the attack and stays alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Playing Cards\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can take it up a level by using playing cards.   Each play is allocated an agreed number of cards at the start of the game.  They are shuffled and dealt randomly.    Use cards sparingly - or not - as they will affect the game big-time.\r\n\r\nPlayers will always have one **blind** card.  That's a card that they are not allowed to look at but just play \"blind\".\r\n \r\nAt the start of the game players can swap cards with each other. Blind cards can be swapped by no-one is allowed to look. So it's blind swapping!.\r\n\r\n### Playing a card. \r\n\r\nAt their turn the player nominates a card and a unit then turns the card over.  The card should explain what you can do with the power up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIt's meant to be fun.  You as the adult are meant to lose, but only just.   Adjust the rules as you go alone.  Some examples.\r\n\r\n### Surrounded player can run away\r\n\r\nIf a player is scared, they can drop their weapons and run with \"4x move multiplier\" back home.  They have to get home before they can recover and pick up more imaginary weapons, miss a turn then return to the fight.\r\n\r\n### Regenerating players\r\n\r\nOn a large battle, you could nominate home, or a moving home could be the battlefield commander location.  This way you could \"respawn\" at your commander.  \r\n\r\n### killing the battlefield commander\r\n\r\nThat player is out of the game and their forces surrender, taken prisoner for another game. \r\n\r\n### Teaming up \r\n\r\nIf you have 4 players, why not team up two teams.   You could, however, betray them with secret pacts with the enemy if you really wanted!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
